# Splatshooter

My friend [William](./CREDITS.md#mission-control) just wanted to make a game similar to Splatoon 3.
<hr>
From the dev team at [REDACTED];

This is just a recreation of Splatoon 3 designed to run in the browser so you can play it on almost any device.

# Currently
No, we did not abandon the project. We aren't able to do anything at the moment cuz I'm busy and CATS is not finished yet.
