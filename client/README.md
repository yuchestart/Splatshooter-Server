Here are the files for the Splatshooter Client.<br>
The Splatshooter Client can be hosted without any back end code, as the WebSocket connections go straight to the server.<br>
This client can also be run locally by downloading the client and opening index.html.<br>
For the first release, the client will be hosted on GitHub pages and can be downloaded.
