MESSAGES SENT BETWEEN SPLATSHOOTER AND THE CLIENT ARE IN THIS FORMAT:
{
    "type":number // Specifies what kind of message is sent (refer to Util.ts)
    "data":any // Specifies the data in the message
    "timestamp":number //What time the message was sent. Automagically assigned.
}
With the new WebSocket code, you can access websockets from anywhere.
This means we can make Splatshooter unblockable.
