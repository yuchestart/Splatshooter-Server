WHEN PLAYER JOINS GAME:
sends notice to server that they joined game
server creates new server player entity
player is assigned to team
server sends notice to all other players to create clientplayerentity
scoreboard is updated to add player across all clients (scoreboard is NOT tracked on server)

EVERY TICK:
Physics tick.
Player inputs are processed.
Each packet in the queue is processed.
All players are sent new positions and any changed data.
    - To minimize amount of data sent, only changed data will be sent to clients. If a client recieves
      incomplete data, they will simply not update it. For example, animation states.
